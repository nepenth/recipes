# Slow-Braised Beef Ragù

## Ingredients

- **1.5 kg (3.2 lbs)** chuck roast, cut into 2 cm (3/4 inch) cubes  
- **200 g (7 oz)** pancetta, finely diced (if available)  
- **2 medium red onions**, finely chopped (about 300 g or 10 oz)  
- **300 g (10.5 oz)** carrots, finely diced  
- **6** garlic cloves, minced  
- **375 ml (1.5 cups)** full-bodied red wine (preferably Barolo or Chianti)  
- **1 jar (24 oz)** strained tomatoes  
- **1 jar (24 oz)** tomato puree  
- **875 ml (about 3.7 cups)** beef stock  
- **2** bay leaves  
- **4 sprigs** fresh rosemary  
- **6 sprigs** fresh thyme  
- **60 ml (1/4 cup)** extra virgin olive oil  
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste  

## Instructions

1. **Season the meat:** Generously season the chuck roast cubes with salt and pepper.  
2. **Brown the meat:**  
   - In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.  
   - Brown the meat in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pot.  
   - Remove and set aside.  
3. **Cook pancetta (if using):** In the same pot, add the pancetta and cook until crispy, about 5 minutes.  
4. **Sauté vegetables:** Add the onions and carrots. Cook over medium heat until softened, about 10 minutes.  
5. **Add garlic:** Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.  
6. **Deglaze with wine:**  
   - Pour in the red wine, scraping the bottom of the pot to release any browned bits.  
   - Bring to a simmer and let it reduce by half, about 5–7 minutes.  
7. **Combine ingredients:**  
   - Return the browned meat to the pot.  
   - Add the strained tomatoes, tomato puree, and beef stock. Stir to combine.  
8. **Add bouquet garni:** Tie the bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme together with kitchen twine. Add this to the pot.  
9. **Simmer:**  
   - Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low.  
   - Cook uncovered for the entire duration (3–4 hours), stirring occasionally and monitoring consistency.  
   - **If the sauce reduces too quickly** and the meat isn’t tender yet, partially cover the pot.  
   - **If it’s not thick enough** toward the end, continue simmering uncovered.  
10. **Check for doneness:** The sauce is ready when the meat is very tender and the sauce has reached your desired consistency.  
11. **Remove bouquet garni:** Take out the herbs.  
12. **Adjust seasoning:** Taste and add salt and pepper as needed.  
13. **Optional final texture:** Use a wooden spoon to break up the meat further if desired.

## Tips

- Keep an eye on the liquid level. The meat should remain mostly submerged for proper braising.  
- If the sauce gets too thick before the meat is tender, add a bit more beef stock.  
- The sauce will thicken slightly as it cools.  
- This ragù pairs well with wide pasta like pappardelle or tagliatelle.  
- It often tastes even better the next day, so consider making it in advance.
